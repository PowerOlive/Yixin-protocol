Yixin-protocol
==============
Yixin protocol is a protocol derived from Gomocup protocol. It is designed because Gomocup protocol has some limitation. Firstly used by Yixin, Yixin protocol supports more commands than Gomocup protocol. [Yixin Board](https://github.com/accreator/Yixin-Board) is a GUI which fully implements Yixin protocol.
