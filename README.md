Yixin-protocol
==============
Yixin protocol is a protocol derived from Gomocup protocol. It is designed because Gomocup protocol has some limitation. Firstly used by Yixin, Yixin protocol supports more commands than Gomocup protocol. Yixin protocol is fully implemented in Gomoku/Renju GUI [Yixin Board](https://github.com/accreator/Yixin-Board).
